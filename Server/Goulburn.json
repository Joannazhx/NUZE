We used the gas heater for 3-4 hours earlier in the evening and woke up to no gas for hot water (showers). \nYou need to contact the owner for instruction to change it yourself, appreciate that it's not easy to judge the level of gas usage left but it's not nice to go a day without a shower.\n- At the time, there was a possum or rats in the roof leading to a sleepless night.
