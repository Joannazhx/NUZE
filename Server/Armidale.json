She loved the property too, and spent hours roaming the paddock, followed by long naps on the front deck overlooking the hills. \n\nI would highly recommend this studio if you are travelling through this area. It\u2019s good for couples only though, as it\u2019s too small for a family. \n\nJust one word of warning if you\u2019re travelling with your dog. The studio shares a common wall with a cottage, and we could sometimes hear the person in the cottage moving about, especially at night when things are quiet. Those sounds freaked our dog out a little bit on the first night, but then she calmed down and got used to it.

Sally's cottage is just a short 5 min drive out of town,  so it is whisper quite.  We will definitely stay there again but longer.  Thanks Sally for sharing your little piece of paradise with us.  You have thought of everything to make your guests feel at home. Your garden is beautiful,  I love that you have so many bird baths and feeders for the wild life.  We even saw your resident hare in the morning,  he is huge. Thanks for a lovely stay.
