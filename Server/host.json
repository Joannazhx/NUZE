Anyway, enough geek speak!\r\n\r\nOn week days I generally get up 6ish for gym and work and/or head to the gym after work, so if you are home during the day, you'll have the house to yourself.

On the weekends we also like to do quick day trips to Port Stephens (about a 40 min drive away). If it\u2019s more on the cold or rainy side, I also don\u2019t mind hitting up the shops.

The comfortable and well appointed villa will keep you at just the right temperature with 4 air-conditioner units throughout the cabin. A Weber BBQ plus a full kitchen ensures that life's culinary pursuits can be well catered for if you should so choose.\r\n\r\nAustar plus a small library of movies via a 50 inch LCD TV set in the lounge provides quality entertainment for the whole family. A 42 inch TV set in the downstairs queen bedroom provides either private viewing in bed or a place for the kids to be entertained while mum and dad have peace and quite in the lounge. Two DVD players allow hired DVD's from Kangaroo Valley Village to be viewed. Enjoyment of your favourite music has not been forgotten with a Bluetooth speaker that will allow you to enjoy your favourite music that is on your own smart device.\r\n\r\nSkyView Villa is positioned right on the golf course but is located in such a manner so as to be completely safe from any stray golf balls. Apart from the golf course the resort offers you bush walks, two tennis courts, a swimming pool, a volley ball court (with beach sand) and giant chess for you to enjoy.\r\n\r\nWhat makes SkyView Villa unique?\r\n\r\nThe combination of fresh air, comfort, wonderful views and tranquillity in the country side makes SkyView Villa a perfect destination to unwind and relax in.
