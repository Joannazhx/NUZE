For entertainment, there is free wifi (I tried it, it works!) and a TV. You will absolutely love the large shower with large shower head.

If Tina and Row haven't already been engaged by Airbnb to be available guides and mentors for how to be an amazing host by creating amazing Airbnb spaces, they should be. We never met Tina and Row because it was an amazingly convenient Airbnb property with self-check-in and check-out, but they were fabulously responsive and gave detailed help on a question about where to get healthy, organic food. They really have set a gold standard for the impeccable traveller experience with Airbnb. Albury is not exactly on the beaten track, and yet it is one of the best properties we have ever experienced (and we've experienced over 60 properties). We really wished we were staying more than one night. Tina and Row have basically created something like a travel writer's dream. The cool retro furniture, tasteful minimalism art, the typewriter set up in the master bedroom where guests have all typed and posted their messages of gratitude, the completely effortless parking, the charming patio for evening or morning lounging, the luxurious beds, bedding, towels and bathroom, the well-appointed kitchen...all truly amazing. Many properties have these things, but there is something about the spirit that Tina and Row have infused into this space that makes you feel like you are on a grand adventure, perhaps having taking something akin to the Orient Express across the continent to land in this magical dream stop. On top of all this, the space is probably the most absolutely spotless property we have experienced anywhere. That was deeply appreciated. And the surprise to top off all this wonderfulness is the Albury Botanic Garden, one of the most special we have experienced anywhere in the world - and we have experienced many!

Once we walked into Linda\u2019s place we didn\u2019t want to even go outside. Everything was set up so comfortably and well organised. Every little touch was also there, many places state that they supply breakfast (but don\u2019t !!). Linda\u2019s place was great, all the fresh milk, butter, jam, 2 selections of cereal, tea and Nespresso Machine with Coffee Pods ample for the 2 night stay - we used everything (and enjoyed). The wifi was great, suggestions for places to go out e.g coffee etc. we went to Ebden & Olive which was only 5 mins drive away for a great coffee and have a great selection of cheeses & small goods with a great bakery next door too. We ended up buying things from there with a bottle of wine and enjoyed that for dinner in the really comfortable place Linda has arranged. The communications are so fast and detailed in all the replies to requests we had. We felt like Linda was more than a host and more like a family friend.

Not recommended if you have crawling son.\n- Before you left, you were 'obligated' to wash the dishes which nothing stated in the house rules.\n- Before you left, you were also 'obligated' to put furniture back in place.
