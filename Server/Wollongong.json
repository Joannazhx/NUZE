A really good Thai restaurant (Thai Garden) is also a short walk away with excellent caf\u00e9s 5 minutes drive away at Shellharbour. \nA light amount of food was provided (muesli, yogurt, milk, teabags, instant coffee, chocolate, two pieces of bread wrapped in clingwrap and small sachets of butter and vegemite). This could be improved upon with the provision of a full loaf of bread, ground coffee and a plunger and maybe some fruit.\nAlso the ducted air conditioning was excellent with our own controls.

The location of Northpoint Apartments is perfect for a relaxing and entertaining stay in Wollongong.  The apartment itself is perfect for families and is located close to North Wollongong surf beach and all this area has to offer. \r\nThe apartment was very clean on arrival and had all the conveniences that we needed. The entire unit was very comfortable it is quite large with great living spaces and an outdoor area to enjoy a morning breakfast or afternoon cup of tea. The beds were very comfortable, the unit complex is very quiet and we all slept really well.  The kitchen had everything we needed and we cooked a few meals which certainly saves a bit from having to eat out all the time. There was also a secure garage located on the basement/ground level of the complex for our car.  \r\nCommunication with Rekah and Das was excellent and we knew what we needed to bring with us. If we needed anything or had a query Rekah and Das were only a phone call away and although we didn't need to contact them that often it was reassuring to know that they lived on site and were able to help. They even offered to give us a lift to the wedding reception we were in Wollongong for!! Great Hosts!!   \r\nThe location of the unit is great, walking distance to just about everything.  The North Wollongong surf beach which is nearby, is patrolled and makes swimming very safe. The walks along the waterfront were terrific and we certainly made the most of the lovely weather to enjoy this area.  Being close to restaurants and cafes enabled us to have a coffee after our walks and have the occasional breakfast or dinner out. The North Wollongong Railway station is a short walk from the unit and we also enjoyed a nice day trip to Sydney. It meant we didn't need to find a carpark or have concerns about leaving our car in the street. Supermarkets and shopping centres are only a short drive  or bus ride away. Local bus stops are located near the unit and Wollongong has a good transit system with a free city circuit bus routes which will take you to most areas you need.  We had our own car which enabled us to visit family while in Wollongong and also explore some of the local areas of interest including the Sea Cliff bridge, the Illawarra Fly and other local beaches in the area.\r\nFinally I would like to highly recommend Northpoint Apartments to anyone, Rekah and Das are fantastic hosts and the apartment is first class in all respects.
