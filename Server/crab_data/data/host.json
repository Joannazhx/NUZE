Anyway, enough geek speak!\r\n\r\nOn week days I generally get up 6ish for gym and work and/or head to the gym after work, so if you are home during the day, you'll have the house to yourself.

You may get to meet some of them :)\r\n  \r\nIf you come stay, I hope you will feel as at home here as you would at your own place.  You're basically a house mate while you're here.

I\u2019m a fun, energetic mum of twin girls. A perfect day for me is waking up, doing a quick session at the gym, then heading off to a local cafe with my husband and girls. If the weather is nice, I love to go for a walk with my family. Or even take a stroll by the beach on my own. On the weekends we also like to do quick day trips to Port Stephens (about a 40 min drive away). If it\u2019s more on the cold or rainy side, I also don\u2019t mind hitting up the shops. Then later going out to dinner, and finishing the night with a good Netflix session. \n \nMy husband\u2019s loves Newcastle in the winter. His favourite things to do are catching the local soccer and rugby games, trying new cafes and restaurants, and taking a romantic day trip to the Hunter Valley (approx 45 mins drive) or even catching a live show there. Can't forget to mention he loves to go fishing on Newcastle harbour.\n \nI\u2019ve lived in Newcastle all my life, so I not only love the lifestyle, but I have plenty of local knowledge. I\u2019ve seen it grow from a very industrial place into a buzzing city with a whole new vibe.

There are trendy new bars popping up in ex-laundromats (The Edwards), a surf club that would give Icebergs in Bondi a good run for its money (Merewether Surfhouse), and even a bar in a mutil-million dollar renovated car workshop (Parry St Garage). But if you were to ask me for my top 5 \u2018Newy' must - sees they would have to be: \n1. A walk along The Anzac Memorial Walk\n2. A visit to the old retro Tower Cinemas - which have pretty much not changed since the 80\u2019s\n3. Walking along the Breakwall and seeing the big ships come in\n4. Taking the kids to the rock pool at Bar Beach\n5. Heading to King Edward\u2019s Park and watching the kids run up and down the hill with also some of Newcastle best views. \n \nIf there\u2019s else anything you need to know, or would like any more of my personal recommendations on cafes, restaurants, parks, shops, or things to do, I\u2019d be happy to help.", "name": "Diana", "picUrl": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/7aa013e0-e971-417c-b2b6-b959109c4e6c.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small", "room_ids": ["21540939"], "join_in_date": "2017"}, "47605736": {"detail": [], "self_intro": "I'm a full time marriage celebrant who loves to live a full, happy and healthy life.

Now with two teenage children plus being based in Sydney, the opportunities to go down to SkyView Villa are not as numerous as they were when the two children were younger. So they have decided to share SkyView Villa with others in the hope that you also gain the immense enjoyment that staying at SkyView Villa has brought them.\r\n\r\nEva purchased SkyView Villa in 2000.\r\n\r\nWhy did Eva choose Kangaroo Valley?\r\n\r\nSkyView's stunning views set the backdrop for a relaxing holiday where it is all too easy to unwind. The comfortable and well appointed villa will keep you at just the right temperature with 4 air-conditioner units throughout the cabin. A Weber BBQ plus a full kitchen ensures that life's culinary pursuits can be well catered for if you should so choose.\r\n\r\nAustar plus a small library of movies via a 50 inch LCD TV set in the lounge provides quality entertainment for the whole family. A 42 inch TV set in the downstairs queen bedroom provides either private viewing in bed or a place for the kids to be entertained while mum and dad have peace and quite in the lounge. Two DVD players allow hired DVD's from Kangaroo Valley Village to be viewed. Enjoyment of your favourite music has not been forgotten with a Bluetooth speaker that will allow you to enjoy your favourite music that is on your own smart device.\r\n\r\nSkyView Villa is positioned right on the golf course but is located in such a manner so as to be completely safe from any stray golf balls. Apart from the golf course the resort offers you bush walks, two tennis courts, a swimming pool, a volley ball court (with beach sand) and giant chess for you to enjoy.\r\n\r\nWhat makes SkyView Villa unique?\r\n\r\nThe combination of fresh air, comfort, wonderful views and tranquillity in the country side makes SkyView Villa a perfect destination to unwind and relax in.
