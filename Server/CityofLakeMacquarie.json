The house has a great location, and the room is clean and comfortable. \n\nHowever, the place might suit certain type of travellers better than others.

The bath mat is soaking wet all the time, and didn't get changed. The house is spacey and beautiful, but built with timber. Almost no sound isolation, and we can hear people walking around the house clearly in the room, as well as people using the bathroom and toilet. Again, maybe because it's the long weekend, people came back in the house very late, then took shower in the shared bathroom till after 1AM. On top of that, there is a small fridge in the room making noise, we hardly can have a decent sleep. Plus, there is no curtain in the room because it's next to a rocky wall, so the bright sun light woke us up just after 6AM.

She has 2 rooms available and this in the back room that looks onto a retaining wall (no view to look at), although the room itself is very nicely presented and appointed. All the floors are wooden so if you are a light sleeper, the noise from people walking around the home, especially guests who might be staying in the other room near yours, can wake you (it did my wife and I). There is also a bar fridge in the room, which is handy if needed, but also makes noise as fridges do. Again, if your a light sleeper this might be something to keep in mind. There are also no curtains on the window, and even though it's highly unlikely someone would walk at the back of the property, it can make you feel a little uncomfortable undressing. The morning sunlight also comes in as soon as the sun rises, so if you not used to this it can mean your up a lot earlier than you intended.\nIf you don't mind some noise and having to share a bathroom then we can recommend this place as the room and home are very well presented and with lots to offer."], "176684187": ["Nathalie", "Even though we just stayed one night at Vanessa\u2019s place, the stay was amazing!

On arrival, we just realised there are more guests than we expected  . That means even though as advertised there is spa (in a ground level shared bathroom), we do not feel comfortable enough to walk all the way up there and occupy that bathroom (I dont feel very 'private' and it can easily distrub other guests in the ground level).And yes the description said there is table tennis and gym equipment but they are right next to other guest's rooms/living area.  It would be noise/privacy issue. I do not feel welcome in using it in morning / later evening (most travellers go out during the day time anyway)\n\nBathroom: \nNo door lock in share bathroom! (A simple door lock will provide simple security and privacy)\nWe had to be very carefully not 'splashing' water everywhere as there is only one showerscreen and the water just wont go to 'wall side'/the floor drain(due to the poor floor 'surface tilt') Even though we or other guests turned the shower head towards the wall, the shower floor would still naturally be very wet after shower. Suggest having another showerscreen installed or at least leaving a absorbant mop instead of asking guests to wipe after use..That will make guests feel more relaxed and enjoyable in their bathroom in their holiday time. Owner written on wall that guests need to put toilet paper in the small bin  next to the toilet bowl as it can block the toilet. I think its not very nice for guests to see others' used toilet paper .Owner may leave some sanitary bag in the bathroom for guests to place their used item inside ,before dumping into the bin. \n\nWe have been renting with Airbnb in Australia and oversea. We enjoy 'cleaning' free holiday most of the times (of course we did wash our dishes, dried n placed them back and left the house condition clean and reasonable on leaving). Its our first time to see instructions written in toilet bowl, shower head and bathroom wall (eg:  guests are expected dump toilet paper in the bin, to wipe the basin/ bathroom floor after use) and on arrival, on one of the instruction card, it said:  remove pillow cases/used sheets and placed them in laundry. I think its fair if owner wrote that expectation clearly in the advertisement so guests can decide if they are happy with these expectation before renting.\nOwner is responsive.  Owner is living onsite and approachable.
