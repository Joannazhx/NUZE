It was spotlessly clean. Anne-Maree (the host, not local) was courteous, considerate and prompt to respond. I had some special needs queries and she did her best to accommodate them. There were very helpful welcoming notes and local information, and it was a very enjoyable space to relax in (I stayed for nine nights). \n\nThe (single) bed I slept in was comfortable, the shower was fantastic and I really appreciated the skylight in the (spacious) bathroom. Nice big TV, with plenty of DVDs and CDs available. I would have loved to have spent more time on the back deck if not for the extreme heatwave (a string of 45 degree days, which, by the way, the air conditioning handled like a breeze). \n\nThe kitchen is basic, however, with lots of conveniences. The saucepans could use an upgrade so if cooking is a big thing for you, it's something to keep in mind. Some of the kitchen stuff is stored in a cupboard in the laundry so best keep an eye out for that.\n\nThe fragranced laundry detergent used for the linen and bedding would most likely not suit asthmatics and those with chemical sensitivities/allergies, however, that's an easy thing to fix so could easily change in future. Best to check first if you have any concerns.\n\nThere's a bit of a blindspot when backing out of the carport (across a footpath/cycle path), so best to do so slowly and attentively (or back in instead). There's a bit of traffic noise, however, it's mostly just cars so fairly unobtrusive (unless you are particularly sensitive to that - it's nothing like the full-on traffic noise of a main arterial with trucks and all.) \nThe neighbourhood seems fairly quiet, and the location is just a few minutes away from the convenience of the centre of town.
