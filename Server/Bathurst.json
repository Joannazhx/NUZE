We even attached photo evidence of a large clump of hair on top of the shower drain, sticky stains on the bathroom floor and water/toothpaste stains on the mirror. \n\nRather than offer to have the room cleaned while we were out at dinner, offer a discount, or even apologise, he responded with an sms simply saying the cleaner claims she cleaned the premises. As such, we resigned ourselves to the fact that we would simply have to manage with no bathroom and to request a part refund for the portion of the premises that was unusable during our stay.   \n\nAfter our stay we requested a refund, at which point Benny became aggressive and began leveling all kinds of hurtful and untrue accusations at us; and our child (all things he did not mention prior to our request for a refund). We are clean, educated, well mannered people who have received positive reviews for all our air bnb stays. In fact, we received a good review from the host we stayed at the night before. \n\nIn keeping an open mind and manage a degree of fairness, I invite you to assume that the experience we had with Benny was a one-off event.
