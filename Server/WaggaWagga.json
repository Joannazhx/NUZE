On arrival, we loved the  studio immediately - it was very tastefully decorated and Rebecca certainly has a talent for interior design.  Her choice of colour combinations for the decor and furnishings was awesome.  The studio was spotless in all respects and we wanted for nothing. Rebecca had even turned on the air-con to ensure the place was cool for us which was very much appreciated as the day was around 31 degrees. Quality linen and towels were provided and ample supplies for a healthy breakfast including fresh fruit, bread, spreads, cereals, milk and plenty of tea, coffee, sugar etc. There were even home made biscuits to have with a cuppa. A variety of phone chargers was provided as was a cute hand made game of Noughts & Crosses!  DVDs and CD's were available although we did not use them. TV reception was great, free Wi-Fi provided, the bed was extremely comfortable and we had an awesome night's sleep - refreshed ready for our journey home to Sydney. We cannot praise this Air BnB accommodation enough - it would suit the fussiest of couples. We would love to have stayed a few more nights and explored Wagga Wagga - a good excuse to return in the future.

It was a neat and tidy space, and I enjoyed my stay there very much.\nI only have a couple personal dislikes.

I booked and paid for one room, what I do or who I bring into that space is my business (obviously to an extent) But having to get approval to bring an extra guest over is a bit much I think.. If I wanted to get permission to bring someone home, I would've stayed with my parents. \nThe other is Grants communication to me was stale at best. AirBnb to me is usually very warm and inviting, staying at someones personal property I always put in the extra effort to introduce myself, make them aware of my intentions, ect..  Its just nice to ensure both parties have a mutual understanding. \nGrants only communication to me, was him sending the link to \"how to check in\" unfortunately not the most inviting welcome.\nHowever this is my personal experience, and I did enjoy the space and facilities.
