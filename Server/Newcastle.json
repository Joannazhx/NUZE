Far from being a shack, this compact studio is actually very stylishly renovated, and thoughtfully planned in the style of a \"tiny house,\" filled with clever space saving ideas, everything you need, and nothing you don't.  We were surprised to find heated towel rails, full length mirror, and frosted shower screen, which aren't really shown in the photos.  Even the contemporary black over-sized tap ware is perfect for filling the kettle - everything about this apartment just \"works.\"  The shower pressure is perfect, and beautiful tiling throughout ties the whole space together.  The bed is extremely comfortable - 4 feather pillows, and spare blanket are supplied.  It wasn't cold when we stayed, but there is also a heater if needed.  \nPetra kindly provides muesli and milk for breakfast, along with tea and coffee supplies.\nWe ate out for lunch and dinner during our stay, but enjoyed the view from the window seats over breakfast and happy hour.  We were lucky enough to see a pod of dolphins in the surf from our vantage point, although we missed the whale that Petra had seen earlier in the day. \nSelf check in and check out was super easy with the lock box, and Petra kindly provided us with a resident parking permit to display on our car dashboard.  (available by request)\nA map of the inner Newcastle area, wifi password, and many restaurant recommendations, were gratefully accepted.\nBeing an historic terrace house, there are steps to negotiate from the studio to street level, however these are well lit at night to ensure they are safe.\nWe absolutely loved our stay in Newcastle, and feel it is an extremely under-rated city, with so much to offer, easy to get around on foot to everything,  beautiful historic buildings everywhere, and a really cool vibe.

I\u2019ll start with the pros: the property is in a great location, the house is big and spacious, and is pretty clean everywhere (apart from the one small cockroach we saw in the kitchen), and when we arrived Kerry gave us lots of information about what to see and do in the local area.\n\nBefore I continue, I would like to state that we booked this home at the last minute as a stop on our way to Byron Bay, so all we looked at was the price and location, and we didn\u2019t fully read the description written by Kerry, and we were unaware of a rule that we broke - you\u2019re not allowed to cook after you\u2019ve checked out.\n\nWe were very sorry for doing this, and we feel that Kerry handled the situation in an unfair manner.  We were out all day, and didn\u2019t have transport booked until 9pm, when we returned to the home we thought to cook some food as we hadn\u2019t eaten and we wanted to have something cooked as we were arriving at our next destination very late. Kerry came in while we were cooking and advised us that this was not part of the deal, we understood, cleaned up everything we were using, apologised, and advised that as soon as the food was cooked that we would pack it up. We didn\u2019t have enough Tupperware, so I ran to get some. When I came back, my girlfriend told me that Kerry felt the need to mention to her next guests about our rule breaking (she was told this by the guests, who really didn\u2019t mind us being there), and that Kerry had told my girlfriend \u2018you better leave\u2019 when I came back. \n\nIt was 5pm by this point, and my girlfriend was left feeling very awakened and uncomfortable, despite apologising at every opportunity that she could. We had to wait in the streets for our bus for 4 hours.\n\nWe felt very bad for not reading the full description, and for breaking this rule, we do not deny what we did. But we feel that Kerry could have dealt with it differently, as we cleaned everything up instantly and as soon as we could get the food off of the hob, we did. The kitchen was cleaner than when we started! There was no one around who wanted to use the kitchen either. And we certainly didn\u2019t enjoy waiting for our bus, hungry and cold.

Jane was fantastic, checking up via message to make sure we found our way alright and was flexible in how we checked in.\n\nThe only other thing to note which is outside Jane's control is that the light from the street is quite bright and even with curtains closed left quite a bit of a glow, also some random people outside the apartment walking by can get noisy but that settles down later into the night. The staff vacuuming outside you can hear them quite loudly, but nothing we can do about it and it didn't detract from our experience overall.\n\nThank you so much"], "46274056": ["Kate", "This place is a gem!

I don't think I would have liked to stay up there as an adult (low roof!) but she loved it, and there's a stairgate so we felt safe. Diana really thoughtfully left us amenities which meant we didn't have to go and buy shampoo/shower gel etc when our little travel-sized ones ran out. There was also milk, tea bags and vegemite!
