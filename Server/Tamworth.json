There is a front verandah and we sat there and chatted whilst overlooking the hills in the distance and the churches of West Tamworth.  The street is very quiet and opposite is a vacant block.

A bit of an older house with the eccentricities of age (squeaky floor boards!). Modern touches and very comfortable beds made for a pleasant stay. We didn\u2019t get to use the back garden but I can imagine kids having a lovely time running around. Communication was good and self check-in very convenient. Car was parked off the road under the carport and the house was easy to find."], "33688382": ["Patrick", "What a great house! Garron was very helpful with local advice and tips. Checkin was a breeze.

The house was clean and inviting on arrival, and most rooms had a little indoor plant or vase of flowers which was a lovely touch. There were 4 adults staying - myself, my husband (we stayed in the main room) and 2 of our friends that were not a couple stayed in the twin king single room. There was plenty of space for all of us and if someone was using the main bathroom there was always the second half bath to use. After a long drive from Sydney we thoroughly enjoyed kicking back on the large covered back deck, and relaxing in the hammock. There was a loaf of fresh bread, tea and coffee (including a pod machine), milk, butter and cereal for breakfast provided. Garron was always super quick to respond to any messages, but we also had complete privacy throughout our stay.
