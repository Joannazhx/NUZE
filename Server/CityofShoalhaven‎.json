Nicky & Steve's hospitality is beyond generous - from coffee to wine to their kind check-ins during our stay\n\n3. The house is about 3 minutes walk from Greenfield Beach. Even after seeing other 8 beaches in the area (all stunning) Greenfield remains our favorite as it is less known, more secluded, smaller than Hyams and with some magical atmosphere.\n\n4. The overall location in Vicentia is also strategic as you are in the most beautiful section of Jervis Bay, directly on some of the best beaches and only 10 min drive from the Booderee National Park (as opposed to staying around Callala which require a longer drive to get to the good stuff)\n\n5. Grilling seafood at night while drinking wine from Shoalhaven was definitely a highlight of the trip. \n\n6. The large bed is one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on. And the outdoor warm shower is the best way to wake up or rinse after a day at thee beach (there's a shower in the bathroom, too:)\n\nThank you so much - couldn't have had a better time and will definitely visit you again soon!"]}, {"Jun": {"2019-06-01": [false, 170], "2019-06-02": [false, 120], "2019-06-03": [true, 120], "2019-06-04": [false, 120], "2019-06-05": [false, 120], "2019-06-06":

However, the kitchen facilities are limited so if you are a massive foodie/cook you may be a little disappointed - it didn't bother us. Also, I would say that although the accommodation is ideal for a couple I would be reluctant to have a larger group (more than 2) - the sofa bed is the only other sleeping option and it's pretty small.

A kettle for a nice cup of tea to have on the deck as the sun goes down, a fridge for a bottle of wine for your barbecued dinner, and matches to light your outdoor citronella candles.\nThe bathroom was magnificent. Soap, towels, shampoo and conditioner. Our hair smelt like a distinct range of flowers and berries. The shower was impeccable! It's open-aired, giving you an opportunity to take in the nature around you and the heater in the tent made it possible for you to wash you sun soaked hair before you slept.\nMy partner and I had an alarm on to watch the sunset but for the life of us, we could not get out of bed. On our second night there, we slept a full 10 hours of sleep.\nOverall, our stay was one to remember.

The cottage is perfectly located, a minute walk from everything in the town, and a fairly short drive to all other outdoorsy activities we wanted to do (check out the kayaking place up the road)! We also decided we wanted to spend one night in, and cook our own dinner, and there was conveniently a hot plate, toaster, microwave etc. If you do decide to cook, just note that you should probably bring food with you, as we had trouble locating the nearest place to buy groceries we forgot (but maybe that speaks more about us than anything).
