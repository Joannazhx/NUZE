The house is big enough for a large group and close to fantastic cafes, restaurants and is convenient driving distance to the zoo. For those dining in, the fully equipped kitchen makes catering for a large group easy. For the smallest guests, a large garden is the perfect place to play. I would recommend Alison's house to larger groups visiting Dubbo."]}, {"Jun": {"2019-06-01": [false, 197], "2019-06-02": [false, 194], "2019-06-03": [false, 196], "2019-06-04": [false, 185], "2019-06-05": [false, 185], "2019-06-06": [false, 185], "2019-06-07": [false, 185], "2019-06-08": [false, 211], "2019-06-09": [false, 206], "2019-06-10": [true, 185], "2019-06-11": [true, 185], "2019-06-12": [false, 185], "2019-06-13": [false, 185], "2019-06-14": [false, 212], "2019-06-15": [false, 213], "2019-06-16": [false, 210], "2019-06-17": [true, 185], "2019-06-18": [false, 185], "2019-06-19": [false, 185], "2019-06-20": [false, 185], "2019-06-21": [true, 185], "2019-06-22": [false, 185], "2019-06-23": [false, 185], "2019-06-24": [false, 185], "2019-06-25": [false, 185], "2019-06-26": [false, 185], "2019-06-27": [false, 185], "2019-06-28": [false, 185], "2019-06-29": [false, 185], "2019-06-30": [false, 185]}, "Jul": {"2019-07-01": [false, 185], "2019-07-02": [false, 185], "2019-07-03": [false, 198], "2019-07-04": [false, 187], "2019-07-05": [false, 185], "2019-07-06": [false, 185], "2019-07-07": [false, 185], "2019-07-08": [false, 185], "2019-07-09": [false, 185], "2019-07-10": [false, 185], "2019-07-11": [false, 185], "2019-07-12": [false, 185], "2019-07-13": [false, 185], "2019-07-14": [false, 185], "2019-07-15": [false, 185], "2019-07-16": [false, 185], "2019-07-17": [false, 185], "2019-07-18": [false, 185], "2019-07-19": [false, 185], "2019-07-20": [false, 185], "2019-07-21": [true, 185], "2019-07-22": [false, 185], "2019-07-23": [false, 185], "2019-07-24": [false, 185], "2019-07-25": [false, 185], "2019-07-26": [false, 185], "2019-07-27": [false, 185], "2019-07-28": [true, 185], "2019-07-29": [true, 185], "2019-07-30": [true, 185], "2019-07-31": [true, 185]}, "Aug": {"2019-08-01": [false, 185], "2019-08-02": [false, 185], "2019-08-03": [false, 185], "2019-08-04": [false, 185], "2019-08-05": [false, 185], "2019-08-06": [true, 185], "2019-08-07": [true, 185], "2019-08-08": [true, 185], "2019-08-09": [false, 185], "2019-08-10": [false, 185], "2019-08-11": [true, 185], "2019-08-12": [true, 185], "2019-08-13": [true, 185], "2019-08-14": [false, 185], "2019-08-15": [false, 185], "2019-08-16": [false, 185], "2019-08-17": [false, 185], "2019-08-18": [false, 185], "2019-08-19": [true, 185], "2019-08-20": [true, 185], "2019-08-21": [true, 185], "2019-08-22": [true, 185], "2019-08-23": [true, 186], "2019-08-24": [false, 185], "2019-08-25": [true, 185], "2019-08-26": [true, 185], "2019-08-27": [true, 185], "2019-08-28": [true, 185], "2019-08-29": [true, 185], "2019-08-30": [false, 185], "2019-08-31": [false, 185]}, "Sep": {"2019-09-01": [true, 185], "2019-09-02": [true, 185], "2019-09-03": [true, 185], "2019-09-04": [true, 185], "2019-09-05": [true, 185], "2019-09-06": [false, 185], "2019-09-07": [false, 185], "2019-09-08": [false, 185], "2019-09-09": [false, 185], "2019-09-10": [false, 185], "2019-09-11": [false, 185], "2019-09-12": [false, 185], "2019-09-13": [false, 185], "2019-09-14": [false, 185], "2019-09-15": [true, 185], "2019-09-16": [true, 185], "2019-09-17": [false, 185], "2019-09-18": [false, 185], "2019-09-19": [false, 185], "2019-09-20": [false, 185], "2019-09-21": [false, 185], "2019-09-22": [true, 185], "2019-09-23": [true, 185], "2019-09-24": [true, 185], "2019-09-25": [true, 186], "2019-09-26": [true, 185], "2019-09-27": [true, 185], "2019-09-28": [false, 185], "2019-09-29": [false, 185], "2019-09-30": [true, 185]}}, 60], "20556822": [[-32.2361, 148.63962], "John Brass.
