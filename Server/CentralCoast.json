Having the choice to swim or sit in the sauna was great. Temperature inside was never an issue with the air conditioner working well.

Catching taxi's to and from dinner was a non-issue. A beautiful area to stay in and we will be coming back to Avoca.\n\nCons: Whilst yes the pool is private in the sense that it is yours only to use, privacy was definitely an issue. Lovely but loud family next door can see you in the pool, and if you go to lean on the balcony you can see into their pool and they see you too. If you score a lucky break and neither house on each side is occupied then enjoy! Also had to clean all the debris off the top of the pool before each use. Sauna didn't work but Paul was available via phone to talk us through resetting it and even offered to drive out the next day from Sydney if we couldn't fix it (thankfully we got it going). Dirty European pillows (hair) and Dirty dishes/glasses. $80 housekeeping fee if you leave any mess (ironically, such as dirty dishes) and you must remove all rubbish to the bins outside before leaving.

The communal spa and pool were great, however the halls and resort building were dimly lit, had paint peeling off the walls and had a bit of a dialect feel. The check in was also tricky.

The view from the deck is not the same as the images, when we went there was no water visible, but we didn't use that area much so that didn't impact our stay much. Overall, it was a very nice stay and we enjoyed it and we were very comfortable and cosy!"], "1459713": ["Aaron", "What a wonderful place for a weekend retreat from the stresses of Sydney. This little piece of paradise sits perfectly upon a beautiful bay. The attention to details within the interior of the home are thoughtful and tasteful as well. It\u2019s amazing how you an only be an hour from Sydney and feel a million miles away. Would stay again in a heartbeat. Awesome."], "62843039": ["Htun Wai Yan (William)", "A decent 5 star location.

Shame we were only staying for one night."], "6672006": ["Amy Aisha", "This is a great little place. Clean, stylish, and lots of little extras that made it seem like we were really being welcomed. The little deck and jetty overlooking the water were a great place to sit and watch the world go by.\n\nWas great that we could use the lockbox to check in and out without the need to contact the hosts. Made it super simple to just show up and leave when we wanted. \n\nThe house is about 15 minutes from the train station and town. The town doesn't have that much to offer, but we weren't missing anything because we could prepare simple food where we were and were happy enough sitting by the water. We also hopped on some local buses to take us to some of the local beaches.\n\nOverall, we had a lovely stay."], "18193882": ["Samantha", "Very comfortable arrangements.

Mark and Anne were very welcoming and generous with supplies, even a welcome card and bottle of wine - really kind touch.  There is no view from the unit but walk down beside the house and the jetty is there - I swam twice (only possible at high tide) but beautifully quiet and calm.
