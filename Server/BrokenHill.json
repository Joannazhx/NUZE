The dining, kitchen, bathroom and laundry all work perfectly and are very well equipped.  Three of us (a couple and a single) had a great week staying here and highly recommend it."], "66849265": ["Beck", "Fantastic place right in the thick of it. Close to The Palace, Silly Goat and other eating, and a short drive to Living Desert, Silverton and Mundi Mundi. The house is lovely and exactly as described. You'll have everything you'll need. And the back yard is classic outback! Lovely in summer with the air conditioning. I did tinkle the ivories. Thank you Jay - I'll be back.

The townhouse was really fabulous,  and to be honest, a fantastic surprise inside based on the typical Broken Hill 'tinny' outside.  Much more room than expected,  the kitchen fully kitted and the outside area was great for barbecuing and relaxing at the end of the day.  A top class accommodation! Jay was also very forthcoming with details and offered to show us around on arrival,  which wasn't necessary as everything was clearly laid out with instructions.  Thanks very much.
