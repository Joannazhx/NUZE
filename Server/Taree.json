The same thing was waiting for us the next day after we arrived home from working at the Bonnie Wingham Scottish Festival in the freezing, strong wind. The property is very easy to find, quiet and peaceful and absolutely beautiful. We couldn't have been more comfortable for our two night stay and were reluctant to leave.

It  had an amazing backdrop of the river with fantastic facilities to kick back, relax and enjoy the tranquillity and beauty of nature. Maurie was an excellent host, he greeted us and made sure we knew of all the water and land activities available. All we needed for an anniversary getaway including the beautiful double spa bath which my 9 year old son enjoyed thoroughly! We are looking forward to returning soon to Maurie's.
