Clean,  roomy and thoughtfully maintained. \nThe bed was the most comfortable bed ever. \nThe accommodation was exactly as described.

Everything was clean, homely, accessible, and very very generous. It felt like I was staying in a hotel! So much was provided in terms of towels, plenty of extra blankets, shampoo, conditioner, soap, cutlery, jam, the list goes on. I can't fault my stay at Julie's, I actually found myself reluctant to pack up because I would have loved to extend my stay there.
