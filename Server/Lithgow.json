Also, although there is plenty of parking nearby, much of it is time limited on weekdays and before 12.30 on Saturdays. However, Judy was very helpful in telling us where we could park, and this was not a problem for us. Lastly, the staircase to access the apartment is fairly steep.

As it was about 7pm it was quite difficult to locate the house and it was dark. None of the lights was turned on to welcome us and it took a while to find the key into the house.\n\nOn the first night, only one of the two heaters provided was working. We informed Juanita the next morning and she quickly replaced it with a new one before we were back home in the evening. Even with two heaters, we were still rather cold in the night as the temperature was about 7 degrees at night even though it was not yet winter and we were not used to the cold, being from a tropical country. Also, the power would trip whenever we connected two heaters in the same room and it was a waste as we were not able to hang out in the living area together. Future guests should take note to bring extra warm clothing. Might be just us tropical folks, but Bowenfels is really cold at night. Would recommend travellers to bring more warm wear and bathroom slippers. The tiled floors were really freezing. \n\nUpon arriving, we were excited to use the bathtub, which was a main factor for us to choose to stay there. However, hot water running from the shower and all the taps in the house were of a slightly rusty colour and it was a shame that we didn't get to use the bathtub. Also, we found that the floor of the bathroom would be wet after every shower, even though we followed instructions to place the curtains in the tub and to turn on the exhaust fan when showering. \n\nOtherwise, the location of this place is good, about a 3-4 hour drive from Sydney, and a 45 minute drive to the Echo point lookout. Also, coles was just a 5 minute drive away which will be good for future guests who are planning to cook. Pots, saucers, cups and utensils are available at the house. However, the house is not equip for cooking so may need to buy condiments such as oil, salt and pepper if you intend to cook.

"], "43715822": ["Luna", "Nice, cosy house but central heating barely works throughout leased out end of the house so ensure you pack extra warm clothes for the night if you are staying here in winter. Also ensure you are able to find the rubbish bin and put all rubbish in it before you check out as it's not included in the cleaning service that you pay for even if it's just a pizza box and some chip packets etc. or you will receive a bad review."], "6551631": ["Zahirah", "It was a lovely place to stay since I'm travelling with my family, this house has that homey feeling to it.
