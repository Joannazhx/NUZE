There was a very strong mold smell coming from the bathroom so I wasn't able to shower and dust in the kitchen and on the skirting boards. Due to the bathroom odor I slept with the door open but don't recommend this - there are a lot of pigeons that roost on the air conditioning unit and balcony in the morning which woke me up plus there is no screen door. Also the host lives next door - you can hear through the walls and has two cameras set up which weren't mentioned in the ad; one as you enter and another right in your face as you are leaving the apartment which I found a bit excessive, especially because it wasn't mentioned in the ad.

Generally we found it quite good but there are a few things to be aware of when considering this place. \n\nFirstly, the single garage can really only be used by a very small car due to the narrowness of the driveway, and the position /size of the garage. The problem with this is that if you can\u2019t fit in the garage (and many cars I suspect will struggle to fit), the parking on the street is timed 2 hour parking between 8am and 6pm. I had been intending to park in the garage and walk into the Parramatta CBD each day to attend a conference, but due to the parking issue I had to take my car and pay for parking in the CBD. Not a massive issue but good to be aware of and for us meant a change of plan.\n\nInside the townhouse the place is ok. It was clean and tidy and seemed to have everything you would need. It could probably do with a coat of paint and new carpet (that had underlay) but it did function well enough. The linen was good. The double bed in the main bedroom creaks badly when you move, but apart from that was comfortable enough.\n\nDownstairs is the living area which has a tiled floor and can be quite cold in the evenings and morning, but doesn\u2019t appear to have heating.
