On top of that, the location of the apartment was next door to quite a large garbage hold.  This resulted in a foul smell at all times which in parts was extruciating.   To top this off, there were live maggots crawling outside the apartment door and we had to walk around them every time we left the apartment.  It was truely disgusting.   It appears this is an ongoing issue as Kelvin had placed a weatherstrip on the door to prevent the maggots entering the appartment.

The next morning, the power was still cut and we were left without any clear information about the situation nor any ETA on the resolution (communication with the host was really difficult, although he seemed to be really sorry about that). As we were there for work and were relying on the Internet connexion, we decided to found a new place for the last 3 nights and were finally refund but with no compensation (the whole situation cost us an extra 500$ in addition of the stress and the hassle and we got only 200$back).
