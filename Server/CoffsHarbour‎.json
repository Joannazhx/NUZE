For me personally the area is not very nice we didnt feel that safe and was constantly moving my newly bought car due to this and not to mention the yelling we had to endure from the neighbours . We did have to wipe clean the  fan in room as soon as we walked in due to the thick layer of dust ( im very allergic to dust mites ) also rubbish had not been emptied either and few more hangers would be nice (only 2!). The soap provided in the bathroom is a very used bar of soap which is not very higienic so please bring your own . Coffs Harbour area is amazing especially the marina and muttonbird park is a must do and see . Also you have a gorgeous beach 7 minutes walk from the place .

Anthony is a really nice guy & easy to communicate with. i like to keep my reviews accurate & honest, because there is a lack of it on airbnb & more people need to review both good qualities & the negative qualities. otherwise some guest just get disappointed, having high expectations based on recent reviews, only to find that the reviews didn't mention any of the negative qualities, and for some guest the negative qualities are not an issue, but for others it is. so i encourage guest to be fair in reviews, but most importantly to be truthful."], "4784057": ["Tracey", "We arrived late to Magnolia Cottage but this was no problem for Anthony and he had left the lights on to make finding the place easy.

Although we sadly didn't get a chance to meet him, Haddy comes across as an experienced and thoughtful host via his communications which made our experience all the better.\n\nAs acknowledged by the host and other reviewers, Haddy and Fran's place is near the highway and has stairs, which can be a bit daunting but proved managable. There is also quite dense vegetation which, combined with the warmer climate, resulted in a great host of mosquitoes greeting us on arrival (but the downsides stop there).\n\nHaddy had thoughtfully prepared the place for our arrival so it was a relief on escaping the mosquitoes to enter the house and be greeted with the coolness of the aircon.  We were impressed with the smart kitchen and having the upper floor to ourselves felt like a luxury. There was a good selection of breakfast and even dinner foods available which was much appreciated as we were not inclined to go out for dinner. The bed was comfortable and despite the noise from the highway, when you're tired you don't care about background noise all that much. The hot water system was a bit fiddly - I could achieve either slightly scalding or chilly but sadly not Goldilocks temperature, but I did (hopefully) achieve the goal of a relatively short shower!

Location very good if looking for the harbour end of town. Place was clean and theres a sitting area outdoors. Friendly owners and good communication and instructions for check in. The only thing I would say, is that the studio is technically connected to the owners home. There is an interior door (locked on thier side and lockable from studio side) that leads to thier own home. Thier general living area seems to be above the studio and the door that is connected, is a bottom floor utility room or entry way to thier home?. Either way, you can hear the owners upstairs and also they were active and making some noise (talking etc) in the adjoining room, at around 8am, which woke me up.  There was some snoring during the night and general activities in the morning that could bother some guests, who are looking for quiet.  Cant really fault the place, but I would say that its marginal that its incorrectly advertised/as 'entire place', as it technically could be classed as being within thier home.
