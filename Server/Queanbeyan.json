From Day 1, they made us feel at home. Terry picked us up from the airport and Margie made a lovely Indian meal for us. They were always there for us with their advises and support and still are. The Garden En-Suite room is a super place to stay and we really enjoyed our stay there. The place is nice and cozy which leads into a lovely garden. Next to the room is a nice Barbecue area which can be used for Barbecues or just chilling out. We had all the facilities in the room including high speed internet. They are very immaculate and fine in their selection of things in the room. You will not find such a lovely place in Canberra for such great value. We would highly recommend this place.

A lot of thought and care has gone into designing this space - to name just a few things: lots of storage space to unpack + good clothes hangers, very comfortable bed with lovely bed linen + extra blankets, lots of tourist info, great shower, fresh flowers, a decent sized table, excellent heater, good off the road parking etc.   Unexpectedly finding a bottle of bubbly in the fridge with a card wishing my husband a happy birthday was another lovely welcoming touch :)\r\n\r\nOur dog also enjoyed her stay.

Wifi slow at times or didn't connect.\n\nI stayed for 16 nights. Nice, cozy place that had what I needed. Hosts (in my case house sitters) were easy to get a hold of. Very friendly dogs, but they are guard dogs, so they did bark when I arrived late at night. There was very little toilet paper when I arrived and I got three rolls upon request and was told if I need any more, I should buy it myself. I'm not familiar with guidelines for Airbnb hosts, or if there are any. I understand I haven't booked a hotel room and trying to see it from the host's point of view as well and not demanding much, but I've counted on that the basic amenities mentioned in a listing are for the entire stay, and really the least a host can do for a traveler is to provide the basics. I was allowed to wash my laundry two times. Had fresh towels approx every 5 days, like I wished to have. I found it a bit weird, though, that the fridge, that was in the room when I arrived, was actually for sale and was sold during my stay, so it was replaced with the original, much smaller fridge. Of course none of my business, why this was done this way,  but I wish I had been told the fridge might be replaced mid stay - I had wiped it clean and filled with food to last for my stay and all of a sudden it's replaced with a much smaller one, I could barely fit all my groceries in it, and it was dusty inside and out. Sorry to the next guest, but I only had a few days left to stay and had already wiped one fridge clean, so I just didn't bother cleaning this one.\nNot meant as negative feedback, but just as info, I did see quite a few SPIDERS in the unit and was occasionally bothered by beetles and moths. I do realize I'm in Australia and there are insects everywhere; like I said, not meant as negative feedback, just giving a heads up to whoever might find the info necessary.\nI wished there was a photo of the BATHROOM in the listing; sometimes I don't book a place solely because there is no pictures of the bathroom, but this time I took the risk and I was not disappointed. Spacious and functional, clean bathroom. Big sink, big mirror, spacious shower.\nWIFI was slow or did not connect at times, but good most of the time.\nHosts work often in the garden during the day, so not completely private.\nLOCATION wasn't very suitable for ME. I tried not to let this affect the overall score, because I do realize I should have done better research, my own bad for not doing it. This is maybe more of a feedback on the Airbnb search system (not the host) and a note for people in the same situation as me (evening person, traveling on a budget and no driver's license)  looking to book this place; I searched for a place in Canberra and Terry's place came up in the search, so I just assumed it was in Canberra, but only in the booking confirmation I noticed it's actually in NSW, so eg. the MyWay public transport card doesn't cover this area. The main reason I booked this place was because the listing said there are frequent buses to Canberra and bus stop 100m away. However, (frequent is a relative concept) I used (Hidden by Airbnb) and only found three connections a day on weekdays from the bus stop 100m away. There was another bus stop 850m away with buses approx once an hour on weekdays, last bus leaving 7pm to Canberra, last bus back from Canberra 6pm, after that it's an approx 35min walk to/from Queanbeyan bus station. At night no public transport in either direction.\nIGA supermarket about 20min walk away, other supermarkets ca 35min walk away, lots of nice cafes and restaurants 20 to 30min walk away.\nQuiet, very nice neighbourhood."], "178168390": ["Shidah", "Terry's place is small but clean, and has everything we need in an airbnb.

In a time where many airbnb rentals are dedicated solely to renting; Omars place is lived in, with loads of books to read and artwork on the walls.   It holds all the furniture and household items you'd expect to find in someones flat.  This gave it a homely feel that (depending on who you are) allowed us to feel comfortable and relaxed.   If you don't have a car this place would hands down be the best place for you to rent as it is so close (5 mins walk) to Coles, Woolies, foodcourt, Kmart, dominoes you name it.  We stayed during the long weekend so prices were a little more expensive at a tipple over $100 per night in total, so whilst cheaper than a hotel the place was a little older and although the cleanliness of the flat didn't worry us I could imagine my mother and a few of my neurotic friends spending a couple of hours doing a thorough clean before feeling comfortable.  The block of flats  it was situated in were a little bit reminiscent of housing commission flats and I did feel the need to remove my valuables from the car just to be safe although there probably wasn't a need to do so.  The weather that weekend was absolutely boiling in the mid 30's and so although the place heats up Omar had lots fans around the place to utilise, unfortunately no reverse cycle air con.  For the regular price that Omars place is usually advertised at none of these really minor points would even rate a mention and his place is fantastic; obviously as prices climb one may notice these in passing.  Helen Omar's mother communicated with us and she was fantastic! So easy going and friendly.  She was super helpful, gave heaps of great information about check in and out and always answered speedily.  The bed was really comfortable. Although the parking space which sits between two metal poles is a little squeezy you have heaps of time and room to manoeuvre in and I think most people wouldn't have much of an issue.  I have a really wide late model Alfa Romeo, took it slowly and didn't have any problems.  The towels are absolutely top notch, thick white, new and clean.
