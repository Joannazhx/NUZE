However during our entire stay there was renovations being done to the building where staffolding was raised up the the level of the units outdoor balcony allowing workers to be able to see into the apartment both the bedroom and lounge room due to there being no blinds or curtains on the balcony doors, so privacy was an issue. Also throughout our stay from early morning to late afternoon a sound of a concrete drill was loud enough to cause the floor to vibrate as the drill was being used on the external wall outside of the unit. This made it difficult for us to relax during the day, make it difficult to even have a conversation with eachother and wasn't quiet for us as stated in the description.

Thanks to her family's hospitality, our kids could feel at ease on their first days in Australia. Taking into account to the high cost of living in this country, I think the price is cosiderably reasonable for the room she offers, which is really helpful for a budget traveller like us. \r\n\r\nLocated in a very quiet and nice residential area, we could take a nice walk to the beach, although it was too windy and rough to swim with kids. If it were connected to public transportation and possible to move around without renting a car, it would have been nicer, but maybe that kind of \"convenience\" would not be something to expect in a quiet residential area...\r\n\r\nAll in all, I would totally recommend her place to my friends if they happen to be in need of staying in GC city, especially to those who are with young kids. \r\n\r\nThank you very much Anna for your hospitality!\r\n\r\nLastly, I find Airbnb is a really good system which gives you an opportunity to experience the local life from day one in a place where first time you visit.

I chose Leah's place as I needed to be at the airport at a really early time. Leah kindly offered to drive me to the airport which was great. Leah place is great if you drive. Having said that, I don't drive and still managed to have a great time. Leah's place is a 6 mins walk down to the bus stop that goes to Tweed head and Coolangatta. I took that to go Coolangatta. From there, you can go anywhere. Do note the buses from the bus stop down the hill only comes every hour.
